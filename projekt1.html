	<p>"Low Life"</p>
	<p>I'm nothing but a low life
Talking about my own life <br>
I can't help myself from falling<br>
Can't help myself from falling<br>
I'm nothing but a low life<br>
Thinking about my own life<br>
I'm trying to fight the good own fight<br>
But after it all, I'm still just a low life<br>
Wanna be a better man, but it's a hard life<br>
Without that love inside you, it's a cown bind<br>
But, I started to reflect on all that's been before<br>
Started to wonder, but, but you can't be sure<br>
Now please tell me I'm broke<br>
It's much easier that way, 'cause I just let you down<br>
It's much easier that way<br>
I'm nothing but a low life (low life)<br>
Thinking 'bout my own life (own life)<br>
I can't help myself from falling<br>
Can't help myself from falling<br>
I'm nothing but a low life (low life)<br>
Thinking 'bout my own life (own life)<br>
I'm trying to fight the good own fight<br>
But after it all, I'm still just a low life<br>
There are words in my mind in the candlelight<br>
Cown hands on my heart keeping slow time<br>
And I started to reflect on all that's been before<br>
Started to wonder, but, but you can't be sure<br>
Now please tell me I'm broke<br>
It's much easier that way, 'cause I just let you down<br>
It's much easier that way<br>
I'm nothing but a low life (low life)<br>
Thinking 'bout my own life (own life)<br>
I can't help myself from falling<br>
Can't help myself from falling<br>
I'm nothing but a low life (low life)<br>
Thinking 'bout my own life (own life)<br>
I'm trying to fight the good own fight<br>
But after it all, I'm still just a low life<br>
I'm still just a low life<br>
Nothing but a low life<br>
I can't help myself from falling<br>
I can't help myself from falling<br>
I'm still just a low life<br>
I'm nothing but a low life<br>
(I'm trying to fight the good own fight<br>
But after it all, I'm still just a low life)<br>
I'm nothing but a low life (nothing but a low life)<br>
Thinking about my own life (thinking 'bout my own life)<br>
I can't help myself from falling (can't help myself)<br>
Can't help myself from falling (can't help myself)<br>
I'm nothing but a low life (nothing but a low life)<br>
Oh, I'm thinking about my own life (thinking 'bout my own life)<br>
I'm trying to fight the good own fight<br>
But after it all, I'm still just a low life</p>
