	<p>"Low Life"</p>
	<p>I'm nothing but a low life
Thinking about my own life
I can't help myself from falling
Can't help myself from falling
I'm nothing but a low life
Thinking about my own life
I'm trying to fight the good own fight
But after it all, I'm still just a low life
Wanna be a better man, but it's a hard life
Without that love inside you, it's a cown bind
But, I started to reflect on all that's been before
Started to wonder, but, but you can't be sure
Now please tell me I'm broke
It's much easier that way, 'cause I just let you down
It's much easier that way
I'm nothing but a low life (low life)
Thinking 'bout my own life (own life)
I can't help myself from falling
Can't help myself from falling
I'm nothing but a low life (low life)
Thinking 'bout my own life (own life)
I'm trying to fight the good own fight
But after it all, I'm still just a low life
There are words in my mind in the candlelight
Cown hands on my heart keeping slow time
And I started to reflect on all that's been before
Started to wonder, but, but you can't be sure
Now please tell me I'm broke
It's much easier that way, 'cause I just let you down
It's much easier that way
I'm nothing but a low life (low life)
Thinking 'bout my own life (own life)
I can't help myself from falling
Can't help myself from falling
I'm nothing but a low life (low life)
Thinking 'bout my own life (own life)
I'm trying to fight the good own fight
But after it all, I'm still just a low life
I'm still just a low life
Nothing but a low life
I can't help myself from falling
I can't help myself from falling
I'm still just a low life
I'm nothing but a low life
(I'm trying to fight the good own fight
But after it all, I'm still just a low life)
I'm nothing but a low life (nothing but a low life)
Thinking about my own life (thinking 'bout my own life)
I can't help myself from falling (can't help myself)
Can't help myself from falling (can't help myself)
I'm nothing but a low life (nothing but a low life)
Oh, I'm thinking about my own life (thinking 'bout my own life)
I'm trying to fight the good own fight
But after it all, I'm still just a low life</p>
